Outlet: 
  Used to render the children file in the parent

Routes:
  - root.tsx is the parent and inorder to render the routes it should be a child of root.tsx. 
  This can be acheived by Outlet from 'remix'


Routes/
  index.tsx => default child of root.tsx
  jokes.tsx => '/jokes' child of root.tsx 
  
  jokes/ 
    index.tsx => default child of jokes.tsx
    new.tsx => '/new' child of jokes.tsx
    parameterised routes
      $jokesId.tsx => '/<anything>' child of jokes.tsx (matches any values other than the existing ones)

  jokes.funny.tsx => not a child of jokes.tsx but has the endpoint '/jokes/funny'
